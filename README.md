This is my home application server. 
Its a barebone implementation of jetty and allows for custom endpoints.

## Add custom end points
Basically, add your endpoint into the HandlerList and add a new class to handle the Mapping. Easy as cake. 

## Licensing
All under MIT 2.0. Be kind. Use it wisely.
